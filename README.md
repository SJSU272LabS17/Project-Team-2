Project Idea #1 Stock market predictor:

Making an investment is always a risk, especially in the ever changing market. We aim to provide an analytics solution that will improve over time to help investors making the correct decisions. Using 2 factors, stock market performance and twitter mining analysis, we want to give a predict model, with a % of confident level, for stocks of a particularly publid traded company. Twitter data mining will serve as a base for market analysis, identify a trend of public opinion about a certain product. Based on this and the data extrapolated from stock performance analysis, our model will give a confident level in % and a recommendation for when the stocks are good to sell or good to buy.

Project Idea #2 Freelancer platform for charitable electronic work, and other freelance work:

We borrow this idea from your blog, but we want to tweak this so that this freelancer will be a platform for both employers and employees. Example scenario: A student who has some free time to fix computers/do some technical work can put up his profile and someone who has the need for such an IT savvy person can browse the database and hire him.

This platform will allow non-profit charitable organization to post their work which volunteers can pick and assign themselves. The work can be anything like, preparing a database, spreadsheet, tabulating, grading papers, etc..) once finished on time and correctly, volunteers can earn badges which can be showcased on Linkedin or facebook.

Project Idea#3: Grocercy Bargain:

Every year united states throws away one-thirds of the food it produces causing billion dollar wastage. Infact some of major retailers dispose the food 3 days before the sell by date as customers no longer choose them. The major cause of this wastage is due to the lack of awareness among the customer regarding the whereabouts of the products,sell-by-dates and the discounted prices at which they are available.
	
we propose a solution to this by creating a common platform for the sellers of retail outlets to post about these items with specific details about products as below

a)Type of the product
b)Quantity
c)Sell-by-date
d)discounted price proposed
e)details about condition and physical damage if any.

When a buyer logins into the portal he can view the quantity,discounted prices,sell-by-date, seller details with location from different retailers ,to choose the best product according to his need.

we can also enhance the platform in future to help sellers improve and maintain their customer base by introducing loyality points for every purchase that can be used for goods purchase in website.


OLD IDEAS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Idea #1: Stock market predictor
The program will analyze and build a predict model for any company based on their market performance, products, accquisitions, and innovations. This will also take into account how people react to certain product annoucements, future planning, and roadmaps. The result will indicate if it's a good time to buy a company's stock, or sell it.

Project idea #2: Twitter data mining
With many companies releasing several products every year, it's important to understand the market and see which products are most likely to sell, or if consumers are unsatisfied with any services. This can range from a new cool app to the new iPhone to an ISP's new internet service. By analyszing the trends on twitter (aka how many people retweet a certain product, or how many hastags related to a product...) We can give a prediction if said product will be a hit among consumers.

Project idea #2b: Reactions analysis using twitter data.
This is a twist of the above, instead focusing on multimedia consumption. 
The program will be analysing users tweets based on a hashtag,for example we would like to know reactions in social medial just after a movie release or an HBO series episode that just aired. The algorithm here would be to classify the tweet dataset into common pool of reactions and then generate dynamic plots expressed by users all around.
