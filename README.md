# Project-Team-2

For this semester we have the following ideas for our project:

Project Idea #1: Stock market predictor
The program will analyze and build a predict model for any company based on their market performance, products, accquisitions, and innovations. This will also take into account how people react to certain product annoucements, future planning, and roadmaps. The result will indicate if it's a good time to buy a company's stock, or sell it.

Project idea #2: Twitter data mining
With many companies releasing several products every year, it's important to understand the market and see which products are most likely to sell, or if consumers are unsatisfied with any services. This can range from a new cool app to the new iPhone to an ISP's new internet service. By analyszing the trends on twitter (aka how many people retweet a certain product, or how many hastags related to a product...) We can give a prediction if said product will be a hit among consumers.

Project idea #2b: Reactions analysis using twitter data.
This is a twist of the above, instead focusing on multimedia consumption. 
The program will be analysing users tweets based on a hashtag,for example we would like to know reactions in social medial just after a movie release or an HBO series episode that just aired. The algorithm here would be to classify the tweet dataset into common pool of reactions and then generate dynamic plots expressed by users all around.
