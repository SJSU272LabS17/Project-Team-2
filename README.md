# Project-Team-2
New idea goes here:
Still discussing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD idea:
For this semester we have the following ideas for our project:

Updated idea #1:
We will combine idea #1 and #2, as we want to mine data from twitter to use it for our predict model about the stock market. For instance, we gather trends on twitter about a certain product (a new iPhone, a new AMD chip...) and see if the stock for those companies that make the products will go up or down. This is one of the factors for our predict model, along with stock analysis. At the end, our program will give a confident value and recommendation for if a company's stock is a good buy or good time to sell. We hope to be able to use some machine learing in analysis the stock market and twitter data.

Project Idea #1: Stock market predictor
The program will analyze and build a predict model for any company based on their market performance, products, accquisitions, and innovations. This will also take into account how people react to certain product annoucements, future planning, and roadmaps. The result will indicate if it's a good time to buy a company's stock, or sell it.

Project idea #2: Twitter data mining
With many companies releasing several products every year, it's important to understand the market and see which products are most likely to sell, or if consumers are unsatisfied with any services. This can range from a new cool app to the new iPhone to an ISP's new internet service. By analyszing the trends on twitter (aka how many people retweet a certain product, or how many hastags related to a product...) We can give a prediction if said product will be a hit among consumers.

Project idea #2b: Reactions analysis using twitter data.
This is a twist of the above, instead focusing on multimedia consumption. 
The program will be analysing users tweets based on a hashtag,for example we would like to know reactions in social medial just after a movie release or an HBO series episode that just aired. The algorithm here would be to classify the tweet dataset into common pool of reactions and then generate dynamic plots expressed by users all around.
